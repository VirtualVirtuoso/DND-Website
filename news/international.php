    <h1>A truly international year</h1>
    <p>
        D&D Int. Eng. have had a truly international year work wise with relocation projects from/to the UK, Hungary,
        Germany, Greece, Algeria, Spain, Lebanon & Egypt. All of the projects were undertaken on a blue chip project
        management basis within budget and to the satisfaction of our customers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Perhaps the most traumatic project was our visit to Cairo, Egypt, during which the riots kicked off and a curfew
        was imposed on the city from 19.00 to 6.00. We decided to leave the following morning to catch a 6.00 flight
        from Cairo and on our way to the airport, was held up by the rebels at various road blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fortunately they did not steal anything but it was a “squeaky bum” time experience; such are the travails of an
        international engineering company who are prepared to go the “extra mile” to undertake projects and succeed at
        our chosen profession.
